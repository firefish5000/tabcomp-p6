A collection of P6 related files that I used/developed.

Links to their project pages should be found here:

Comming Soon:
Cron::Parser
	A Cron-family cronfile parser.
	Current goals are to be able to
	List times CronJobs would run
	List the next CronJobs (a list when two+ jobs would run)
	List the next CronJobs after Time offset,
	Check the vadility of the times (0-9 for dow should fail this test)
	Successfully identify each element of a CronJob
	roughly: &<CronArgs> CronTime<min hr dom mon dow> <user>? CmdLine<[cmd args]+>
Time::RTC_Alarm?
	Goals:
	Detect rtc devices (searche path for { ^ '/dev/rtc' \d+ $ } for now )
	Creates, lists, and remove rtcalarm times. (max: one per device)

The following do not yet have there own project page. If they have been here for a week+ feel free to request I make one.
perl6_family_completion.sh
	bash-completion for perl6 related packeges (currently perl6, panda, and rakudobrew)
	Put it in your bash_completion directory or add
	'source path/to/dir/perl6_family_completion.sh' to your bashrc.
	NOTE: I am consdering splitting this into 2-3 seperate files. So it's currently up for debate
	Panda Support:
	We require a '/panda/projects.json' file to reside in a CompUnitRepo inst: directory for module completion.
	this file is generated by panda on the first update|list|install|search run;
	If Module Completion isn't working for you, try running
	'panda update'
	and try again [panda install DateTim<TAB>]
	You may find that you need to run panda update after 
		1) rakudo|moarvm|parrot|jvm version changes(upgrades/downgrades)
		2) after rakudobrew buld|build-panda commands
		3) after rebootstrapping perl6/panda
	

(I appologize for any misspellings, I don't have a spellchecker in vim at the moment)
