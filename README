Bash completion for perl6 related packages.
Currently provides
rakudo perl6	--	Basic completion for rakudo perl6 and varients.
panda			--	Basic and module name completion.
rakudobrew		--	Basic completion and full switch and build completion.
padre			--	Basic completion
pugs?			--	Comming soon.

perl6_family_completion.sh -- a concateration of all completions into one file.

NOTES:
when sourcing any file from the same directory, be sure to type
`source ./filename'
DO NOT TRY 'source filename' as it may try to source the program named 'filename'
(perl6_family_completion.sh, however, should be fine. since I doubt that is a program's name)  

This complication could be avoided by renaming the files to <programname>_comp or alike.
I chose to leave them as they are to try to follow the apparent
standard naming convention (in /etc/bash_completion.d). 
I figured that the number who would have problems would probably
not be high enough to break convention, however it is up for debate.
(I am not personnaly fond of having to type ./ while testing)
